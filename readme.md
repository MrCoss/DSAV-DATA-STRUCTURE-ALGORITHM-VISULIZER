# DSA Visualizer

An interactive web application built with **React** for visualizing common data structures and algorithms.  
This project provides a hands-on learning experience by animating the core operations of various DSAs, making complex concepts easier to understand.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Watch data structures and algorithms operate in real-time.
- **Step-by-Step Explanations:** A dedicated panel shows pseudocode, key points, and complexity analysis for each operation.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, dark-themed, and responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS.
- **Wide Range of DSAs:** Covers fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms.
